"Bootstrapping WebSockets with HTTP/2" [RFC8441] defines an extension to HTTP/2 [HTTP/2] that is also useful in HTTP/3 [HTTP/3]. This extension makes use of an HTTP/2 setting. Appendix A.3 of [HTTP/3] gives some guidance on what changes (if any) are appropriate when porting settings from HTTP/2 to HTTP/3.

《[HTTP/2引导网络套接字]()》定义了一个针对[HTTP/2]()的扩展，其在[HTTP/3]()中也是有用的。
这个扩展利用了HTTP/2的设置。
[HTTP/3]()的[附录A.3]()提供了哪些改变（如果有的话）是合适的的引导，在从HTTP/2移植设置到HTTP/3中。
